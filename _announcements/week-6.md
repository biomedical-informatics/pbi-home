1. keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the course notebooks.

2. have a go at the new [week 6 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/mb_j74P0) in the GitHub Classroom, this one is for you to query the NCBI GEO system to search for interesting gene expression datasets. Remember these are not assessed, they are for you to practice related coding as the course progresses.

On Tuesday, we will go through background material to cover the principles of how RNA-sequencing is used to measure gene expression and the main methods used to analyse that data to identify genes that are differentially expressed between conditions.

On Thursday I will be working through two notebooks using a Python implementation of the most popular differential gene expression tool DESeq2. The first is a basic script to run through the process and the second is a real example of a published experiment looking for genes that are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
