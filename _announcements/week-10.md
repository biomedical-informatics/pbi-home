On Tuesday, we will learn the value of integrating multiple data modalities using practical examples from biomedicine  across a range of different diseases. Following on from recent week's work our focus will be on modeling at the patient level using networks.

On Thursday we will be working through two notebooks that use networks to model multiple data modalities. They will take advanatge of the [SNFPy](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy) package that implements the similarity network fusion method proposed in [Wang et al. Similarity network fusion for aggregating data types on a genomic scale. Nature Methods, 11(3), 333](https://europepmc.org/article/med/24464287). The first notebook implements a toy example and the second uses real world data to build multiple modality networks and a fusion approach to integrate data for downstream analysis.

1. We've now finished our coding practice assignments, but there will be some notebooks for you to look at through the week (and beyond!) for this week's course content.

2. Next week we only have one session, on Tuesday morning where I will be running through the course material, discussing the exam, and offering a Q&A session.

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in public). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
