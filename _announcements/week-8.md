1. keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the course notebooks.

2. have a go at the new [week 8 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/zD7wF-AN) in the GitHub Classroom, this one is to practice some consenus clustering. Once again I've decided to release my solution along with the rest of this week's materials for this so you can look at this if you would like to.

On Tuesday, we will learn about network analysis and in particular clustering and functional enrichment analysis with a real world network example derived from the study of Autism Spectrum Disorders.

On Thursday we will be working through a notebook that performs functional enrichment analysis on the TCGA expression dataset that we were working with last week using the [GSEAPy package](https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
