1. If you haven't completed the tasks from weeks 0 and 1 please do so this week.

2. keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the notebooks accompanying each week's work.

3. have a go at the new [week 2 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/oVXQjqAz) in the GitHub Classroom. Remember these are not assessed, they are for you to practice related coding as the course progresses.

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
