#### Tasks for this Week

In our final revision session on Tuesday, we will run through the exam structure, course content, some example short answer questions and review how you structure pseudo-code with suitable commenting using some practical examples.

1. Please do use this time to ask any questions you may have, but we will also be monitoring the Piazza forum right up until the exam so you can as usual ask questions there too.

2. Remember you can download last year's exam [here](https://exampapers.ed.ac.uk/search?query=INFR11260) to give you a concrete example of the question style.

3. A key tip for the exam is to pay attention to how many marks a part is worth and apportion your time appropriately.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
