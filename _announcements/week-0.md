1. Setup or familiarise yourself with a preferred coding environment for coding in Python.

2. [Sign up for a GitHub Student account](https://github.com/education/students) **using your University e-mail address** e.g. ```s12345@ed.ac.uk```. This is because access to the GitHub Classroom for this course has an e-mail address roster to limit access; your GitHub e-mail must match.

3. Join the course GitHub Classroom by [accepting the first mini-assignment - "Introduction to GitHub"](https://classroom.github.com/a/4qR87jpB) and work through this short excersie. Please note this is not assessed, it is to familiarise yourself with GitHub.

4. Check that you can [login to the course discussion board on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/memnomhzr0l6ko) and (only if you would like to), introduce yourself by posting and tagging it with the "introductions" folder and perhaps leave a note of what you are hoping to learn during the course. Note that you can login to Piazza directly here, but may find it easier to click through from the course LEARN page. You should be automatically added to the Piazza class list from EUCLID.

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.
