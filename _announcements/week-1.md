1. If you haven't [completed the tasks from week 0](https://github.com/biomedical-informatics/pbi/blob/initial-release/week0/README.md) please do so this week.

On Tuesday, I will go through VSCode, Noteable, environments and using GitHub with the course, following that please:

1. familiarise yourselves with VSCode whether that's as a standalone on your laptop/desktop or whether you access it through the Noteable service (you are of course allowed to setup whatever coding environment you like)

1. experiment with setting up either conda or venv virtual environments for python and installing pacakges

1. practice using GitHub; the week 0 assignment gives you a basic introduction but the familiarity will help you unlock a lot of it's useful features.

On Thursday we will be working with some notebooks; these are already in this week's folder on GitHub.

1. If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in puclic). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
