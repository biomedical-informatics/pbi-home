On Tuesday, we will learn what terminolgies and ontologies are, their properties and uses to structure biomedical data. This will include several of the ontologies used in health data research and emerging standards to address data interoperability.

On Thursday we will be working through two notebook that operate on ontology structures. The first introduces the [pronto](https://pronto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library that can parse ontology files in various standard formats and provides utility functions to query and manipulate them. The second notebook implements a natural language processing pipeline using the [Allen Institute Scispasy framework](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) to identify biomedical concepts from free-text. We will use this to tag data from publications and map these onto ontologies.

1. keep practicing with your preferred python coding environment using the course notebooks.

2. have a go at the new [week 9 practice assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/6Bh2JJX-) in the GitHub Classroom, this one is to practice augmenting data with ontology derived information and returns to the GenCC data we used earlier in the course. Once again I've decided to release my solution along with the rest of this week's materials for this so you can look at this if you would like to.

If you have any problems **please do ask** by posting a question on the Piazza forum (you can privately message me on there if you do not want to ask a question in public). I will be monitoring the forum closely throughout the course and this is the best way to get in touch with me.

Remember that I've added some reading and reference material suggestions that some of you may like to refer to for some background biology information. This is entirely optional, you are not expected to read through all these, but may find them useful on occassion during the course. You can find these [here](../resources/biology_catchup.md).
